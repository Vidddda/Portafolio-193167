### 2.1) Exercise 1 — Identify Logical Tasks
| *Task* | *Trigger (Time / Event)* | *Periodic / Event-Based* |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Reads a temperature sensor every *50 ms* | 50 ms timer | *Periodic* |
| Sends sensor data via *Wi-Fi every 2 s* | 2 s timer | *Periodic* |
| Monitors an *emergency button* | Button press | *Event-Based* |
| Blinks a status LED at *1 Hz* | Timer (1 s) | *Periodic* |
| Stores *error messages* when failures occur | Error event | *Event-Based* |

### 2.2) Exercise 2 — Task Characteristics

| *Is it time-critical? (Yes / No)* | *Can it block safely? (Yes / No)* | *What happens if this task is delayed?* |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| No | Yes | It depends on the system; however, in general, the sensor would read the information at the end. |
| No | No | If it takes a while, it would send the data, but if it gets blocked, it could affect communication. |
| Yes | No | It would cause an accident. |
| No | Yes | The LED just looks weird. |
| No | Yes | Only data is lost. |


### 2.3) Exercise 3 — Priority Reasoning
| *Task Name* | *Priority (H / M / L)* | *Justification* |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Temperature | *Medium* | It is important for system operation, but small delays are acceptable. |
| Wi-Fi | *Medium* | Communication is necessary, but short delays do not compromise safety. |
| Emergency button | *High* | It is safety-critical and must be handled immediately. |
| LED | *Low* | It is only visual feedback and not functionally critical. |
| Error messages | *Low* | Logging is useful but not urgent compared to control or safety tasks. |

### 2.4) Exercise 5 — Suggested Task Configuration
| *Component* | *Type* | *Period / Trigger* | *Priority* | *Description* |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Emergency Button | Interrupt (ISR) | Button press | — | Triggers ISR, no heavy processing. |
| SafetyTask | Task | Notification | *High* | Executes emergency shutdown procedures. |
| TempTask | Task | 50 ms | *Medium* | Periodic sensor reading. |
| WifiTask | Task | 2 s | *Medium* | Sends data without blocking other tasks. |
| LedTask | Task | 1 s (1 Hz) | *Low* | Visual status indication. |
| LogTask | Task | Error event | *Low* | Stores logs asynchronously. |
